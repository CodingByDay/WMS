## Formating

Keep in mind our formatting and variable naming conventions: we use camel case for variables. Ensure your code is clean and readable, with meaningful names and clear comments explaining complex logic. We value maintaining a uniform code style, so adhere to our established guidelines and use ESLint or Prettier for formatting.

## Placeholders

[Eliminate] - Elimination needed in near future
[Discusion needed] - Needs team discussion
